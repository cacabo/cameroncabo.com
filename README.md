**TODO**

- Remove all usage of `as` and instead just put types directly in GQL query
- Use `React.FC`
- Definition for rule '@typescript-eslint/interface-name-prefix' was not found.eslint(@typescript-eslint/interface-name-prefix)
- Update end dates on projects to not be active
- Where is `export type Children = React.ReactNode | React.ReactNodeArray` used?
- Bump ESLint
- Re-deploy to Netlify
- Figure out migration plan away from Gatsby
- Dark mode
