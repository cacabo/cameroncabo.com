**TODO**

- Button should have border not a box shadow or outline should be a proper outline—the current behavior removes box shadow on focus or on click. Also maybe only activate outline for keyboard interactions, not mouse interactions.
- Add lint rules from other repos (react imports, null and undefined, etc.)
- Change many shade props into a single `elevation` prop
- Use `React.FC`
- Remove all usage of `as` and instead just put types directly in GQL query
- Update end dates on projects to not be active
- Bump ESLint
- Figure out migration plan away from Gatsby
- Dark mode
