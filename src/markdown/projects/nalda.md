### History

Nalda aimed to change the way that college-age students consume and explore food options on and near their campuses. My friend Adam Ripley and I worked on this project for a group of Penn students who wanted to turn their idea into a reality.

After a few months working, the founders concluded that they'd struggle to grow to the point where the product would be properly monetizable.

### Lessons Learned

Today, a portion of the data and image work has gone into my work on [Penn Basics.](https://pennbasics.com/) Also, this was the first large-scale project I ever built in React. In developing this, I learned a lot about how to build more maintainable, readable, and extensible projects.
