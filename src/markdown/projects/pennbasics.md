### Overview

Many websites and apps which Penn hosts for its students are antiquated and not particularly data-rich. Through Penn Basics, we want to make sleeker and more informative interfaces for students so they can better understand what Penn has to offer and to take advantage of it.

As we continue building out the product, we plan to move into new verticals and to develop more granular data sets.
