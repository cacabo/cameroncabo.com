Orthly has recently rebranded to [Dandy](https://www.meetdandy.com/) (and with it, has built out a new website!) but it was great to help them out as they iterated on their product and started scaling out their operations. This is a competitive space where brand, marketing, and UX are where players have to differentiateâ€”once you've picked one product you can't really switch to a competitor.

I worked alongside one of the founders (another Penn student, Daniel Hanover) on top of work from a designer to deliver this product quickly.
