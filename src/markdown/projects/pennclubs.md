### Overview

There are some issues with the club recruitment process at Penn. Namely, its stressful and applications can be strenuous. Additionally, smaller, unique community-based clubs tend to get washed out by larger and better funded clubs. This can result in certain people joining clubs that might not really be the best fit for them.

At Penn, finding a supportive community you can learn from and grow in is incredibly valuable. We hope Penn Clubs will democratize the club discovery process by giving each club a voice on our platform and tools for interacting with interested members of the student body.
