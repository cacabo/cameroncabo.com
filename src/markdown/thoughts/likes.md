### Technologies

For life in general:

- [Privacy.com](https://privacy.com) virtual debit cards.

  - Never worry about cancelling a "free" trial or spending money at a small business that you want to support but are afraid is at a higher risk of getting hacked

- [Strava](https://strava.com) cardio tracking and social-fitness.

  - What if more online communities were like this?
  - What if there were a Strava-for-cooking app?

- [Down Dog](https://www.downdogapp.com/) workout (HIIT) and yoga apps.\

  - A workout app which actually works, keeps things interesting (variety), and does not barrage you with ads

- Corners of YouTube where learning is fun and fast.

For software:

- [Netlify](https://netlify.com) performant and affordable hosting with great developer experience
- TypeScript
- Deliberate, expressive internal APIs (not just the REST-kind, all code you write is an API for yourself and other devs)
  - Reusable components / util functions
  - The [pipe](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Pipeline_operator) operator

### Foods

The more-good-than-bad kind:

- Gnocchi (not too hard to make at home!)
- Chicken thighs
- Protein shakesâ€”you can easily include a little frozen spinach, seeds, and/or healthy fats
- Coffee

The more-bad-than-good kind:

- Extra-toasty Cheez-Its
- Chewy Chips Ahoy
- The universe of sweet and salty items

"Diets"

- Intermittent fasting: I generally feel my best when I don't eat until the afternoon
  - Not really a "deit" since you don't have to modify _what_ you eat, but rather _when_
- [Slow-carb](https://tim.blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/tim_ferriss_the-4-hour-chef_one_pager_slow_carb_diet.pdf)

- Poorly-practiced yoga on the roof
- Weight lifting
- Reading in the sun
- Trail running
- Slightly too-competitive pick-up basketball
- Cooking, especially with friends or family
- Sleep, ideally early to bed and to rise
- Road trips
- Camping
- Hammocking
- Anything involving parks
