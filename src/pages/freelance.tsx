    <H3>What I do best</H3>

    <P>
      I build sleek, user-centric websites. All of my work keeps to similar
      practices allowing for rapid prototyping.
    </P>

    <P>
      Each website is completely personalized in content, structure, and design
      in order to best accomplish what the site sets out to.

        Every project is personalized to your budget, timeframe, and
        specifications.

      <H3 mb2>Full-stack, full-process</H3>
      <P lighter>
        I develop, test, and maintain projects of all scales and at all stages.

        Mobile-first, responsive development, cross-platform products.

    <H3>Compensation</H3>

    <P>
      Set projects where we can come up with a well-scoped set of requirements
      are paid based on completion of milestones. More fluid projects are paid
      hourly so we have flexibility in terms of what we build to meet your
      needs. Further, you only pay for the work that I put directly into
      product: hours spent on learning and preliminary research are on me.
    </P>

    <P>
      If you work for a non-profit or a similarly mission-driven organization,
      send me an email and we can go from there.
